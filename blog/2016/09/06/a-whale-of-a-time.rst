I finally got the legitimate chance to enter the happy world of LXC_ in a
professional context. Whilst I realise I am somewhat late to the party\ [#]_,
the experience was pretty great (even on a Mac) so I thought I would share my
thoughts.

**********
Before anyone gets excited, I’m not writing application code that calls LXC
libs directly; although, being a well-backed\ [#]_ project, there are bindings
for Python\ [#]_ so that notionwouldn’t be too far from the realms of reality.
No, I’m going through Docker_ like everyone else.
