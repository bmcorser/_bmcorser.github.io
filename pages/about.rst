What’s up?
##########

I’m a programmer. I write code in Python, Bash, C++, Elm and JavaScript. My code does
automation, data processing, analysis and presentation. I’ve also been known to
produce the odd web application. I also really like maths.

Things I do outside Vim:

    - Run ``docker`` commands
    - ``tmux`` for my life!
    - Poke around in databases of all kinds
    - Profile that last line of code
    - Keep my trees tidy with ``git rebase -i`` [#]_

`:pear: :fish_cake: :fried_shrimp: :sushi:`

Things I do inside Vim without a browser open:

    - Make teapots dance and other triangle-based activites
    - Make things turn transparent with SQLAlchemy
    - Implement nice ETLs
    - Sit down with Pandas and have a good think
    - Automate all the things [#]_ to deploy yo’ webapps

`:dango: :watermelon: :rice: :herb:`

Things I do inside Vim with a browser open:

    - Prototype unicorns with Elm and Vue.js
    - Just loads of ``_.chain`` and ``_.reduce`` (it’s a low dash)
    - Pilot the good ship Django

`:beer: :runner: :birthday: :tropical_drink:`

Things I do in a browser:

    - Make my Pull Requests real pretty
    - Wait for Chrome to reopen the 40 tabs I had open
    - Enthusiastically berate my digital butler (be he Jenkins, Buildbot,
      Travis, CircleCI, Appveyor)
