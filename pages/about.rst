Whatâ€™s up?

Pythonista and hipster coder extraordinaire (that means I write JavaScript as
well as SQL), I know my periwinkle blue caravans and can get my groove on from
the bottom of the stack to the top.

`:cake: :custard: :shaved_ice: :doughnut:`

Things I do outside Vim:

    - Run ``salt`` commands
    - ``tmux`` for my life!
    - Poke around in PostgreSQL databases
    - Profile that last line of code
    - ``git rebase -i`` [#]_

`:pear: :fish_cake: :fried_shrimp: :sushi:`

Things I do inside Vim without a browser open:

    - Write beautiful Pyramid apps
    - Do crazy cool stuff with SQLAlchemy
    - Wrap things in ``@click.command``
    - Make data dance with Pandas
    - Hammer out Salt states

`:dango: :watermelon: :rice: :herb:`

Things I do inside Vim with a browser open:

    - Either ``{{ x }}`` or ``${y}``
    - Keep it real with Durandal and RequireJS
    - Just loads of ``_.chain`` and ``_.reduce`` (it's a low dash)
    - Occasionally shuffle about in Django

`:beer: :racehorse: :birthday: :tropical_drink:`

Things I do in a browser:

    - Make my Pull Requests real pretty
    - Wait for Chrome to reopen the 40 tabs I had open
    - Hang out on ``seclists.org/funsec/``
    - Enthusiastically berate Jenkins, Buildbot, Travis
