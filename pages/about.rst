What's up?
##########

Pythonista and hipster coder extraordinaire, I know my perriwinkle blue
caravans and can get my groove on from the bottom of the stack to the top.

Things I do outside Vim:

    - Run ``salt`` commands
    - Poke around in PostgreSQL databases
    - Profile that last line of code
    - ``git rebase -i``


Things I do inside Vim without a browser open:

    - Write beautiful Pyramid apps
    - Do crazy cool stuff with SQLAlchemy
    - Wrap things in ``@click.command``
    - Make data dance with Pandas
    - Hammer out Salt states

Things I do inside Vim with a browser open:

    - Keep it real with Durandal and RequireJS
    - Just loads of ``_.chain(iterable)`` and ``_.reduce``
    - Occasionally shuffle about in Django

Things I do in a browser:

    - Make my Pull Requests pretty
    - Wait for Chrome to reopen the 40 tabs I had open
