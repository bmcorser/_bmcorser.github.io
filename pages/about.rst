Pythonista and hipster coder extraordinaire, I know my perriwinkle blue
caravans and can get my groove on from the bottom of the stack to the top.

`:cake: :custard: :shaved_ice: :doughnut:`

Things I do outside Vim:

    - Run ``salt`` commands
    - Poke around in PostgreSQL databases
    - Profile that last line of code
    - ``git rebase -i``

`:pear: :fish_cake: :fried_shrimp: :sushi:`

Things I do inside Vim without a browser open:

    - Write beautiful Pyramid apps
    - Do crazy cool stuff with SQLAlchemy
    - Wrap things in ``@click.command``
    - Make data dance with Pandas
    - Hammer out Salt states

`:dango: :watermelon: :rice: :herb:`

Things I do inside Vim with a browser open:

    - Keep it real with Durandal and RequireJS
    - Just loads of ``_.chain(iterable)`` and ``_.reduce``
    - Occasionally shuffle about in Django

`:beer: :racehorse: :birthday: :tropical_drink:`

Things I do in a browser:

    - Make my Pull Requests pretty
    - Wait for Chrome to reopen the 40 tabs I had open
